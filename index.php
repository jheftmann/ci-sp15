								<h5>Lab</h5>
								<p>This course serves as a complement to Core Studio Interaction. The assignments are built to work in tandem with the projects students are developing in the studio class. The lab is designed around a series of small workshops that teach beginning and intermediate interaction design through a hands-on engagement with HTML and CSS.</p>
								<h5>Studio</h5>
								<p>This course exposes students to thorough and elaborate interactive concepts and techniques for applications. It is an extensive investigation in the interface, the mechanism, the controls and the aims of interactive works. Students will learn how to design and develop complex interactive projects and understand how to undertake a comprehensive research and direct their thinking process from brainstorming to final outcome. They will be given the tools to conceive, plan and develop an interactive system and they will become aware of the importance of their role in the development of interactive media.</p>

								<p>There are 3 big buckets of assignments - <span class="txt-strong">Toolbox</span>, <span class="txt-strong">Strategic</span>, and <span class="txt-strong">Final</span>.
								Toolbox projects are meant to be quick (spend no more than 2hrs) and functional. These projects will literally build up your designer’s toolbox and help jumpstart your strategic design projects.</p>

								<p>Strategic projects are small & large exercises that builds up to the final. Each student will be assigned to a group to work together in all of the exercises under the chosen theme.</p>

								<p>Final project is how everything will be cohesively tied together into a presentation.</p>

								<p>Due dates for each project is noted in the calendar.
								Accompanying reading assignments will be noted (& emailed) throughout the semester.</p>

								<p>All projects should be submitted on each student’s Tumblr page. (Even if the Strategic and Final projects are done in groups, each student is responsible for individual documentation).</p>

								<h3>Participation</h3>
							</div>
							<div class="section-content">
								<p>Class participation is an essential part of class and includes: keeping up with reading, assignments, projects, contributing meaningfully to class discussions, active participation in group work, and coming to class regularly and on time.</p>

						</div>

						<div class="subsection">
							<div class="section-header">
								<h3>Attendance</h3>
							</div>
							<div class="section-content">
								<p>Parson's attendance guidelines were developed to encourage students? success in all aspects of their academic programs. Full participation is essential to the successful completion of coursework and enhances the quality of the educational experience for all, particularly in courses where group work is integral; thus, Parsons promotes high levels of attendance. Students are expected to attend classes regularly and promptly and in compliance with the standards stated in this course syllabus.</p>
								<p>While attendance is just one aspect of active participation, absence from a significant portion of class time may prevent the successful attainment of course objectives. A significant portion of class time is generally defined as the equivalent of three weeks, or 20%, of class time. Lateness or early departure from class may be recorded as one full absence. Students may be asked to withdraw from a course if habitual absenteeism or tardiness has a negative impact on the class environment.</p>
								<p>Whether the course is a lecture, seminar or studio, faculty will assess each student?s performance against all of the assessment criteria in determining the student's final grade.

								<p>In rare instances, I may be delayed arriving to class.  If I have not arrived by the time class is scheduled to start, you must wait a minimum of thirty minutes for my arrival.

								<h3>Academic honesty and integrity</h3>
							</div>
							<div class="section-content">
								<p>The New School views "academic honesty and integrity" as the duty of every member of an academic community to claim authorship for his or her own work and only for that work, and to recognize the contributions of others accurately and completely. This obligation is fundamental to the integrity of intellectual debate, and creative and academic pursuits. Academic honesty and integrity includes accurate use of quotations, as well as appropriate and explicit citation of sources in instances of paraphrasing and describing ideas, or reporting on research findings or any aspect of the work of others (including that of faculty members and other students). Academic dishonesty results from infractions of this ?accurate use?. The standards of academic honesty and integrity, and citation of sources, apply to all forms of academic work, including submissions of drafts of final papers or projects. All members of the University community are expected to conduct themselves in accord with the standards of academic honesty and integrity. Please see the complete policy in the Parsons Catalog.</p>
								<p>It is the responsibility of students to learn the procedures specific to their discipline for correctly and appropriately differentiating their own work from that of others.  Compromising your academic integrity may lead to serious consequences, including (but not limited to) one or more of the following: failure of the assignment, failure of the course, academic warning, disciplinary probation, suspension from the university, or dismissal from the university.</p>

								<p>In keeping with the University's policy of providing equal access for students with disabilities, any student with a disability who needs academic accommodations is welcome to meet with me privately.  All conversations will be kept confidential.  Students requesting any accommodations will also need to meet with Jason Luchs in the Office of Student Disability Services, who will conduct an intake, and if appropriate, provide an academic accommodation notification letter to you to bring to me.  SDS assists students with disabilities in need of academic and programmatic accommodations as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and Section 504 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973. <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/studentservices/disability/">http://www.newschool.edu/studentservices/disability/</a>.</p>
